    <p>
      You may well ask: “How can I start using <abbr>HTML5</abbr> if older browsers don’t support it?”
      But the question itself is misleading. <abbr>HTML5</abbr> is not one big thing;
      it is a collection of individual features. So you can’t detect “<abbr>HTML5</abbr> support,”
      because that doesn’t make any sense.
      But you <em>can</em> detect support for individual features, like canvas, video, or geolocation.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may think of <abbr>HTML</abbr> as tags and angle brackets.
      That's an important part of it, but it’s not the whole story.
      The <abbr>HTML5</abbr> specification also defines how those angle brackets interact with JavaScript,
      through the Document Object Model (<abbr>DOM</abbr>).
      <abbr>HTML5</abbr> doesn’t just define a <code>&lt;video></code> tag;
      there is also a corresponding <abbr>DOM</abbr> <abbr>API</abbr> for video objects in the <abbr>DOM</abbr>.
      You can use this <abbr>API</abbr> to detect support for different video formats, play a video,
      pause, mute audio, track how much of the video has been downloaded,
      and everything else you need to build a rich user experience around the <code>&lt;video></code> tag itself.
    </p>

    <p>
      <a href=http://diveinto.html5doctor.com/detect.html>Chapter 2</a> and
      <a href=http://diveinto.html5doctor.com/everything.html>Appendix A</a>
      will teach you how to properly detect support for each new <abbr>HTML5</abbr> feature.
    </p>

    <h2 id="two">2. You don’t need to throw anything away</h2>
    <img src=http://diveinto.html5doctor.com/i/forms.png alt="calendar" align="left" />
    <p>
      Love it or hate it, you can’t deny that <abbr>HTML</abbr>4 is the most successful markup format ever.
      HTML5 builds on that success. You don’t need to throw away your existing markup.
      You don’t need to relearn things you already know. If your web application worked yesterday in <abbr>HTML</abbr> 4,
      it will still work today in <abbr>HTML5</abbr>. Period.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, if you want to <em>improve</em> your web applications, you’ve come to the right place.
      Here’s a concrete example: <abbr>HTML5</abbr> supports all the form controls from <abbr>HTML</abbr> 4,
      but it also includes new input controls.
      Some of these are long-overdue additions like sliders and date pickers; others are more subtle.
      For example, the <code>email</code> input type looks just like a text box,
      but mobile browsers will customize their onscreen keyboard to make it easier to type email addresses.
      Older browsers that don’t support the <code>email</code> input type will treat it as a regular text field,
      and the form still works with no markup changes or scripting hacks.
      This means you can start improving your web forms <em>today</em>, even if some of your visitors are stuck on IE 6.
    </p>
    <p>
      Read all the gory details about <abbr>HTML5</abbr> forms in <a href=http://diveinto.html5doctor.com/forms.html>Chapter 9</a>.
    </p>

    <h2 id="three">3. It’s easy to get started</h2>
    <img src=http://diveinto.html5doctor.com/i/markup-with-arrow.png alt="markup" align="right" />
    <p>
      “Upgrading” to <abbr>HTML5</abbr> can be as simple as changing your <i>doctype</i>.
      The doctype should already be on the first line of every <abbr>HTML</abbr> page.
      Previous versions of <abbr>HTML</abbr> defined a lot of doctypes, and choosing the right one could be tricky.
      In <abbr>HTML5</abbr>, there is only one doctype:
      <blockquote>
        <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html></code>
      </blockquote>
    <p>
      Upgrading to the <abbr>HTML5</abbr> doctype won’t break your existing markup,
      because all the elements and attributes defined in HTML 4 still work in <abbr>HTML5</abbr>
      (although a few are now <a href=http://www.w3.org/TR/html5-diff/#absent-elements title="HTML5 differences from HTML4">obsolete</a>).
      But it will allow you to use — and validate — new semantic elements like <code>&lt;article></code>,
      <code>&lt;section></code>, <code>&lt;header></code>, and <code>&lt;footer></code>.
      You’ll learn all about these new elements in <a href=http://diveinto.html5doctor.com/semantics.html>Chapter 3</a>.
    </p>

    <h2 id="four">4. It already works</h2>
    <img src=http://diveinto.html5doctor.com/i/rel-email.png alt="[form field with onscreen keyboard]" align="left" />
    <p>
      Whether you want to draw on a canvas, play video, design better forms, or build web applications that work offline,
      you’ll find that <abbr>HTML5</abbr> is already well-supported. Firefox, Safari, Chrome, Opera,
      and mobile browsers already support canvas (<a href=http://diveinto.html5doctor.com/canvas.html>Chapter 4</a>),
      video (<a href=http://diveinto.html5doctor.com/video.html>Chapter 5</a>),
      geolocation (<a href=http://diveinto.html5doctor.com/geolocation.html>Chapter 6</a>),
      local storage (<a href=http://diveinto.html5doctor.com/storage.html>Chapter 7</a>), and more.
      Google already supports microdata annotations (<a href=http://diveinto.html5doctor.com/extensibility.html>Chapter 10</a>).
      Even Microsoft — rarely known for blazing the trail of standards support — supports most <abbr>HTML5</abbr> features
      in Internet Explorer 9.

      Each chapter of this book includes the all-too-familiar browser compatibility charts.
      But more importantly, each chapter includes a frank discussion of your options if you need to support older browsers.
      <abbr>HTML5</abbr> features like geolocation (<a href=http://diveinto.html5doctor.com/geolocation.html>Chapter 6</a>)
      and video (<a href=http://diveinto.html5doctor.com/video.html>Chapter 5</a>) were first provided by browser plugins like Gears or Flash.
      Other features, like canvas (<a href=http://diveinto.html5doctor.com/canvas.html>Chapter 4</a>), can be emulated entirely in JavaScript.
      This book will teach you how to target the native features of modern browsers, without leaving older browsers behind.

      Tim Berners-Lee invented the world wide web in the early 1990s. He later founded the <abbr>W3C</abbr>
      to act as a steward of web standards, which the organization has done for more than 15 years.
      Here is what the <abbr>W3C</abbr> had to say about the future of web standards, in July 2009:
    </p>
    <blockquote cite=http://www.w3.org/News/2009#item119>
      <p>
        Today the Director announces that when the <abbr>XHTML</abbr> 2 Working Group charter expires as scheduled at the end of 2009,
        the charter will not be renewed. By doing so, and by increasing resources in the <abbr>HTML</abbr> Working Group,
        <abbr>W3C</abbr> hopes to accelerate the progress of <abbr>HTML5</abbr> and clarify <abbr>W3C</abbr>’s position
         regarding the future of <abbr>HTML</abbr>.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <abbr>HTML5</abbr> is here to stay. <a href=http://diveinto.html5doctor.com/past.html>Let’s dive in</a>.
